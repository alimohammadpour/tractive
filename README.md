## Getting Started

-   Clone the GitHub repository
-   Open the folder in your favourite editor and start coding
-   To view the changes you make, open `index.html` in the browser
-   If you are using VsCode, [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension can be a great help
